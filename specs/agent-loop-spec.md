# Spec: `run_agent()`

**File:** `agent.py`
**Status:** Partially pre-filled — complete the two blank fields before implementing

---

## Purpose

Orchestrate a single conversational turn for the Plant Advisor agent. Given a user message and the conversation history, call the LLM with available tools, execute any tool calls the LLM requests, and return the final text response.

This is the core of what makes Plant Advisor an *agent* rather than a simple chatbot: the ability to decide which tools to call, use their results to inform its response, and loop until it has everything it needs.

---

## Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `user_message` | `str` | The user's current message |
| `history` | `list` | Gradio conversation history — list of `[user_msg, assistant_msg]` pairs |

**Output:** `str`

The agent's final text response for this turn. Should never be empty — if something goes wrong, return a user-readable fallback message.

## Design Decisions

*Read `specs/system-design.md` (especially the "How the Groq Tool Calling API Works" section) before reviewing these. Complete the two blank fields before writing any code.*

---

### Messages list structure

The messages list must start with the system prompt, then replay the conversation
history, then add the new user message. Gradio history is a list of `[user, assistant]`
pairs — convert each pair to two API-format dicts:

```python
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT}]

for user_msg, assistant_msg in history:
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_msg})
    if assistant_msg:
        messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_msg})

messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})
```

---

### Initial LLM call

Pass the model, the messages list, the tool definitions, and `tool_choice="auto"`
so the LLM can decide whether to call a tool or respond directly:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=LLM_MODEL,
    messages=messages,
    tools=TOOL_DEFINITIONS,
    tool_choice="auto",
)
```

---

### Detecting tool calls in the response

The response object has a `choices` list. Index 0 gives the assistant message.
Check its `tool_calls` attribute — if it's truthy, the LLM wants to call tools:

```python
assistant_message = response.choices[0].message

if not assistant_message.tool_calls:
    # No tool calls — LLM has a final answer
    ...
```

---

### Appending the assistant message

When there are tool calls, append the full assistant message object to `messages`
**before** appending any tool results. The API requires this ordering — a tool
result message must immediately follow the assistant message that requested it:

```python
messages.append(assistant_message)  # must come first
```

---

### Executing and appending tool results

For each tool call, extract the name and arguments, call `dispatch_tool()`, and
append the result as a `"tool"` role message. The `tool_call_id` links this result
back to the specific tool call that requested it:

```python
for tool_call in assistant_message.tool_calls:
    tool_name = tool_call.function.name
    tool_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
    tool_result = dispatch_tool(tool_name, tool_args)

    messages.append({
        "role": "tool",
        "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
        "content": tool_result,
    })
```

---

### Loop termination conditions

Condition (a) — no tool calls: After each LLM call, check `assistant_message.tool_calls`. If it's falsy (None or empty list), the LLM has finished reasoning and produced a final text answer. Return `assistant_message.content` immediately.

Condition (b) — MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS reached: The for loop runs at most MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS iterations. If the loop exhausts all rounds without a non-tool response, make one final LLM call with `tool_choice="none"` to force a text response and return that. This prevents an empty return while still exiting the loop safely.

---

### Extracting the final text response

The final text lives at `response.choices[0].message.content`. This is a string when the LLM responds with text. Guard against None with `or "fallback message"` in case the API returns an empty content field.

---

## Implementation Notes

**Trace of a working agent turn (what tools were called and in what order):**

```
Query: "How should I care for my calathea?"
Round 1 tool call: lookup_plant({'plant_name': 'calathea'})
Round 2 tool call: get_seasonal_conditions({})
Final response: Specific calathea care advice with current seasonal context
```

**What happens when you ask about a plant that isn't in the database?**

```
lookup_plant returns {"found": False, "message": "...not in database..."}.
The LLM reads the not-found message, acknowledges the plant isn't in its database,
and offers general guidance for tropical/humidity-loving plants without inventing
specific care data.
```

**One thing about the tool call API that surprised you:**

```
The assistant message containing tool_calls must be appended to messages before
the tool results — even though logically the results "belong" to that call. The
API uses tool_call_id to match results to requests, but the ordering constraint
is strict: assistant message first, then tool results, always.
```
